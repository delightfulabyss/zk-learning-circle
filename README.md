# Zero Knowledge Proof Learning Circle

The Zero Knowledge Proof Learning Circle meets weekly on {Date and Time TBD}. Each week, we will review topics related to Zero Knowledge Proofs and their underpinnings. The curriculum includes The MoonMath Manual by Least Authority, ZK Whiteboard Sessions by ZK Hack, and repositories of various Zero Knowledge projects. Each week, we will read/watch the associated materials and do any associated exercises. During our weekly meeting, we will discuss what we learned.
