# The ZK Way: Zero Knowledge Proof Learning Circle

The Zero Knowledge Proofs Learning Circle meets weekly on {Date and Time TBD}. Each week, we will review topics related to Zero Knowledge Proofs and their underpinnings. The goal is to get us enough of an understanding of the math and tooling that we can begin to build Zero Knowledge applications based on ZK-SNARKS and to feel comfortable diving into further Zero Knowledge topics. The curriculum for this learning circle includes The MoonMath Manual by Least Authority, ZK Whiteboard Sessions by ZK Hack, Circom and SnarkJS documentation, and repositories of various Zero Knowledge projects. Each week, we will read/watch the associated materials and do any associated exercises. During our weekly meeting, we will discuss what we learned.
